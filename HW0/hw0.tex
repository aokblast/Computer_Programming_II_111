\chapter{Requirement}

I recommend to use any Unix-Like OS (e.g. FreeBSD, MacOS, Linux) to finish this
homework. In windows, you can use either Virtual Machine or WSL to install Linux over Windows.

This homework require \textbf{google test} package. Google test is a unit test
library on C/C++. It helps us build test system over
er this homework so that you can check
if you write the correct code. It is avaliable on most of the operating system.
If you use Ubuntu Linux, you can use command \textbf{sudo apt install
  libgtest-dev -y} to install \textbf{google test} package. Other system you need to find by yourself.

\section{Problem 1: Linked List}

Linked list is widely used in operating system kernel due to the high
performance on insert and delete elements compare with other data structures like
array. Linked list can be implemented from pointer, which we have learned in
Computer Programming - I.

\subsection{Requirement}

In this problem, You're asked to implement Linked List of \textbf{int32\_t} in C by
using array. Because you haven't learned structure, I want you to use array to
emulate the linking relationship. You have to modify all of the functions in \textbf{list.c} to
comply with the requirements. There are many types of Linked List. In this
problem I use the definition in C++
\href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list}{std::list}. Not all of
the functions in \textbf{std::list} are required. You only have to finish ones in
\textbf{list.c}. Of course, you can add some auxilary functions to help you
implement linked list.

After accomplishing these requirements, you can run \textbf{make test} to test all of
your codes.
And once you passed all these tests, you finished this problem.

\section{Problem 2: FSM}

I think you have learned Function in CP-I. Also, you have learned Pointer: a variable point to some memory address.
Surprisingly, function also has its address. So pointer can also point to a
function.
To understand how to use function pointer, you can take a look at this website
\href{https://chenhh.gitbooks.io/parallel_processing/content/cython/function_pointer.html}{here}.

\subsection{Requirement}

Function pointer helps us solve many problems. In this problem, You're asked to implement a
\href{https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E7%8A%B6%E6%80%81%E6%9C%BA}{FSM
  ( Finite State Machine )} where each node is a function pointer.
We have to provide one function called \textbf{init()} and several functions with
nodes in this problem, which will return a function pointer of the initial node. The prototype of node function
\textbf{'void *(int)'} has an alias called \textbf{f\_type} in
\textbf{fsm.h}. This function prototype requires an index to indicate the next
node you want to jump, and the return
value will be the pointer to the next function. The reason why the return value is \textbf{void *}
instead of \textbf{f\_type} is the limitation of \textbf{typedef} in C.
We need to do type conversion manually after calling \textbf{f\_type} objects.
Besides from the return value, you are also required to print some information show
in the middle of node in the under graph(e.g. INIT, BBBB) on the
screen when executing the function in each node. Once the index passed to the
function does not exist anymore, you should return the pointer to the current node.
The following graph is the relationship(Arrow), index(First line in the circle),
and the required print string (Second line in the circle). After
finishing it, make sure to run \textbf{make test} to test your code. If the output string is \textbf{OK}, your code is correct.
